# Implementation-of-EfficientNetB5
In this experiment, I will implement the EfficientNet on multi-class image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. To implement it as a transfer learning model, I have used the EfficientNet-B5 version as B6 and B7 does not support the ImageNet weights when using Keras. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a publically available image data set provided by the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR). It consists of 60000 32Ã—32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. The 10 different classes represent airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images in this dataset.
